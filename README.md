# st.connection

# TODO

- Add support for the following:
  - ~~mongodb~~
  - ~~snowflake~~
  - ~~sqlite~~
  - ~~bigquery~~
  - ~~google sheets~~
  - ~~S3~~
  - postgresql
  - mysql
- Add some basic tests for each one
- Allow named connections (so multiple connections per db type are possible)?

  - Could look at connections from snowsql: https://snowflake.slack.com/archives/C03AQAKE6E4/p1665602652453119

- Add automatic in-streamlit documention if credentials are missing

- Add caching
